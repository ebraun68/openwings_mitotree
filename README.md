# openwings_mitotree
Code for the OpenWings mitogenomic tree project

Description of multimitofinder.pl

Simple perl script to run MitoFinder in a consistent manner. It requires MitoFinder (Alio
et al. (2020) abd one of the assemblers that MitoFinder uses (MEGAHIT, MetaSPAdes, or 
IDBA-UD) to be installed, along with the other MitoFinder dependencies (see the MitoFinder
github for details)

The program is straightforward to use; it will provide instructions when called without
command line options:

```
Usage:
  $ ./multimitofinder.pl <ctlfile> <assembler>
  ctlfile   = tab delimited list of mitogenomes to assemble
              (read the comments in this code for format details)
  assembler = program used to assemble reads
              (megahit, metaspades, idba)
exiting...
```
This program reads a control file, which is simply a tab-delimted file with the following
format:

Outfile_name Read_type  Source  Reads/SRR#  Reference
one file per line...

```
Written out the order is:
 	0. Outfile name (e.g., Atlapetes_gutturalis_UWMB93636)
 	1. Read type - S = Single end; P = Paired end
 	2. Source - S = SRA; otherwise the path to the file
 	3. Read file or SRR number
 	4. Reference mitogenome (e.g., Passer_montanus_JX486030.gb)
```

See the example control file for additional details. Note that it is possible to mix reads
from SRA with local files of reads and to mix single end and paired end reads. Obviously, 
you must install SRA tools if you wish to use data in the NCBI SRA
